Prerequisites: 

This assumes you have MS Visual Web Developer 2010 Express installed and configured for your dev
environment.

MS Visual Web Developer 2010 Express can be downloaded at: http://www.microsoft.com/express/Web/
	
Once installed, we will bring this project into MS Visual Web Developer Express. To do this:

1.) Unzip/move the contents of this zip file to your Visual Studio 2010 "Projects" directory.
2.) To open the project, navigate to \Webservices-dotNET-Sample-Project\CascadeTest\CascadeTest and
    double-click on the CascadeTest.csproj file

After this you should see the Cascade Webservices project show up in your Visual Web Developer Express window. Do not be alarmed if 
there are compilation errors, this is because you still need to add the C# client stubs for interacting 
with the web services layer.

To do this:

1.) Right-click on the project ("CascadeTest") in the Solution Explorer window & select "Add Web Reference."
2.) In the URL field enter the url to your Cascade AssetOperationService end point
    (i.e. http://your-cascade-instance/ws/services/AssetOperationService?wsdl). In the
    "Web reference name" field, enter "CascadeWS" and click "Add Reference."
3.) Expand the newly added "CascadeWS" Web Reference in the Solution Explorer window and open the Reference.cs file.
    This is the auto-generated C# implementation for the Cascade web services WSDL.  This file WILL NOT WORK as-is.
4.) Open the \Webservices-dotNET-Sample-Project\CascadeWSDL.cs file in a separate editor window and copy the entire
    contents of this file to your clipboard.
5.) Return to the Reference.cs file opened in step #3 and replace the entire contents of this file with the code
    copied from CascadeWSDL.cs and save.
6.) Right-click on the project ("CascadeTest") in the Solution Exploerer window & select "Build."
7.) Expand "CascadeWSTest.aspx" from the Solution Explorer window and open the "CascadeWSTest.aspx.cs" file.
8.) Verify that the selected asset path and authentication information is valid for your Cascade instance
    and modify as necessary.

At this point you can test your application by clicking the "Start Debugging" button from the toolbar at the top 
(it's the green "play" button).
